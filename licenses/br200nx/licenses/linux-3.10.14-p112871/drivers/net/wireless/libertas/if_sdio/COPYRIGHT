 * This hardware has more or less no CMD53 support, so all registers
 * must be accessed using sdio_readb()/sdio_writeb().
 *
 * Transfers must be in one transaction or the firmware goes bonkers.
 * This means that the transfer must either be small enough to do a
 * byte based transfer or it must be padded to a multiple of the
 * current block size.
 *
 * As SDIO is still new to the kernel, it is unfortunately common with
 * bugs in the host controllers related to that. One such bug is that
 * controllers cannot do transfers that aren't a multiple of 4 bytes.
 * If you don't have time to fix the host controller driver, you can
 * work around the problem by modifying if_sdio_host_to_card() and
 * if_sdio_card_to_host() to pad the data.
