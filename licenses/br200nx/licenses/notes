When the OpenWRT system is built, the primary input file is:
<sdk>/.config

During the initial build, the package Makefiles are parsed
and a number of output files are written to `<sdk>/tmp`.

There is one file in particular that lists all of the packages that
are to be built.
`<sdk>/tmp/info/.files-packageinfo-<number>`

To create (and massage) a file that contains a list of all of the *available* packages
that can be built (`available.packages`), the following command line can be executed
from this (`licenses`) directory.

outputdir=$PWD;pushd ../package; find . -type f -name Makefile | sed 's%^\./%%' | sed 's%/Makefile$%%' > $outputdir/available.packages;popd

To create a file that contains a similarly formatted list of all
configured packages, we can do this:

cp ../tmp/info/.files-packageinfo-* configured.packages

One can use vim to compare the two list files like this:

vi -d configured.packages available.packages
