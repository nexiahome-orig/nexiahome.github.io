 * This program takes autoconf.h as input and outputs a directory full
 * of one-line include files, merging onto the old values.
 *
 * Think of the configuration options as key-value pairs.  Then there
 * are five cases:
 *
 *    key      old value   new value   action
 *
 *    KEY-1    VALUE-1     VALUE-1     leave file alone
 *    KEY-2    VALUE-2A    VALUE-2B    write VALUE-2B into file
 *    KEY-3    -           VALUE-3     write VALUE-3  into file
 *    KEY-4    VALUE-4     -           write an empty file
 *    KEY-5    (empty)     -           leave old empty file alone
