/*
 * A tiny 'top' utility.
 *
 * This is written specifically for the linux /proc/<PID>/stat(m)
 * files format.
 *
 * This reads the PIDs of all processes and their status and shows
 * the status of processes (first ones that fit to screen) at given
 * intervals.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - At startup this changes to /proc, all the reads are then
 *   relative to that.

 * Added Support for reporting SMP Information
 * - CPU where process was last seen running
 *   (to see effect of sched_setaffinity() etc)
 * - CPU time split (idle/IO/wait etc) per CPU
