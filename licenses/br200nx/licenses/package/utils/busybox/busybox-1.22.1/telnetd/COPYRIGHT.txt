 * The telnetd manpage says it all:
 *
 * Telnetd operates by allocating a pseudo-terminal device (see pty(4)) for
 * a client, then creating a login process which has the slave side of the
 * pseudo-terminal as stdin, stdout, and stderr. Telnetd manipulates the
 * master side of the pseudo-terminal, implementing the telnet protocol and
 * passing characters between the remote client and the login process.
