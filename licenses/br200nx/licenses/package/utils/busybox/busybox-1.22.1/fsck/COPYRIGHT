 * pfsck --- A generic, parallelizing front-end for the fsck program.
 * It will automatically try to run fsck programs in parallel if the
 * devices are on separate spindles.  It is based on the same ideas as
 * the generic front end for fsck by David Engel and Fred van Kempen,
 * but it has been completely rewritten from scratch to support
 * parallel execution.

 * Written by Theodore Ts'o, <tytso@mit.edu>

 * Miquel van Smoorenburg (miquels@drinkel.ow.org) 20-Oct-1994:
 *   o Changed -t fstype to behave like with mount when -A (all file
 *     systems) or -M (like mount) is specified.
 *   o fsck looks if it can find the fsck.type program to decide
 *     if it should ignore the fs type. This way more fsck programs
 *     can be added without changing this front-end.
 *   o -R flag skip root file system.
