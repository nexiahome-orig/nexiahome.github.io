 * This is an original implementation of the DES and the crypt(3) interfaces
 * by David Burren <davidb@werj.com.au>.
 *
 * An excellent reference on the underlying algorithm (and related
 * algorithms) is:
 *
 *      B. Schneier, Applied Cryptography: protocols, algorithms,
 *      and source code in C, John Wiley & Sons, 1994.
 *
 * Note that in that book's description of DES the lookups for the initial,
 * pbox, and final permutations are inverted (this has been brought to the
 * attention of the author).  A list of errata for this book has been
 * posted to the sci.crypt newsgroup by the author and is available for FTP.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE ASSUMPTIONS:
 *      It is assumed that the 8-byte arrays passed by reference can be
 *      addressed as arrays of uint32_t's (ie. the CPU is not picky about
 *      alignment).
