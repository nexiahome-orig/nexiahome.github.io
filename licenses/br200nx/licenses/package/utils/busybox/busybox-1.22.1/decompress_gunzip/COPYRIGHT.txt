/*
 * gunzip implementation for busybox
 *
 * Based on GNU gzip v1.2.4 Copyright (C) 1992-1993 Jean-loup Gailly.
 *
 * Originally adjusted for busybox by Sven Rudolph <sr1@inf.tu-dresden.de>
 * based on gzip sources
 *
 * Adjusted further by Erik Andersen <andersen@codepoet.org> to support
 * files as well as stdin/stdout, and to generally behave itself wrt
 * command line handling.
 *
 * General cleanup to better adhere to the style guide and make use of standard
 * busybox functions by Glenn McGrath
 *
 * read_gz interface + associated hacking by Laurence Anderson
 *
 * Fixed huft_build() so decoding end-of-block code does not grab more bits
 * than necessary (this is required by unzip applet), added inflate_cleanup()
 * to free leaked bytebuffer memory (used in unzip.c), and some minor style
 * guide cleanups by Ed Clark
 *
 * gzip (GNU zip) -- compress files with zip algorithm and 'compress' interface
 * Copyright (C) 1992-1993 Jean-loup Gailly
 * The unzip code was written and put in the public domain by Mark Adler.
 * Portions of the lzw code are derived from the public domain 'compress'
 * written by Spencer Thomas, Joe Orost, James Woods, Jim McKie, Steve Davies,
 * Ken Turkowski, Dave Mack and Peter Jannesen.
