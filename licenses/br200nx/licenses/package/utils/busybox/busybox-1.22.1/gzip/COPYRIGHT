/*
 * Gzip implementation for busybox
 *
 * Based on GNU gzip Copyright (C) 1992-1993 Jean-loup Gailly.
 *
 * Originally adjusted for busybox by Charles P. Wright <cpw@unix.asb.com>
 * "this is a stripped down version of gzip I put into busybox, it does
 * only standard in to standard out with -9 compression.  It also requires
 * the zcat module for some important functions."
 *
 * Adjusted further by Erik Andersen <andersen@codepoet.org> to support
 * files as well as stdin/stdout, and to generally behave itself wrt
 * command line handling.
