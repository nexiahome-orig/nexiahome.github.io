 *  BSD Process Accounting for Linux
 *
 *  Author: Marco van Wieringen <mvw@planets.elm.net>
 *
 *  Some code based on ideas and code from:
 *  Thomas K. Dyas <tdyas@eden.rutgers.edu>
 *
 *  This file implements BSD-style process accounting. Whenever any
 *  process exits, an accounting record of type "struct acct" is
 *  written to the file specified with the acct() system call. It is
 *  up to user-level programs to do useful things with the accounting
 *  log. The kernel just provides the raw accounting information.

 *
 *  Plugged two leaks. 1) It didn't return acct_file into the free_filps if
 *  the file happened to be read-only. 2) If the accounting was suspended
 *  due to the lack of space it happily allowed to reopen it and completely
 *  lost the old acct_file. 3/10/98, Al Viro.
 *
 *  Now we silently close acct_file on attempt to reopen. Cleaned sys_acct().
 *  XTerms and EMACS are manifestations of pure evil. 21/10/98, AV.
 *
 *  Fixed a nasty interaction with with sys_umount(). If the accointing
 *  was suspeneded we failed to stop it on umount(). Messy.
 *  Another one: remount to readonly didn't stop accounting.
 *      Question: what should we do if we have CAP_SYS_ADMIN but not
 *  CAP_SYS_PACCT? Current code does the following: umount returns -EBUSY
 *  unless we are messing with the root. In that case we are getting a
 *  real mess with do_remount_sb(). 9/11/98, AV.
 *
 *  Fixed a bunch of races (and pair of leaks). Probably not the best way,
 *  but this one obviously doesn't introduce deadlocks. Later. BTW, found
 *  one race (and leak) in BSD implementation.
 *  OK, that's better. ANOTHER race and leak in BSD variant. There always
 *  is one more bug... 10/11/98, AV.
 *
 *      Oh, fsck... Oopsable SMP race in do_process_acct() - we must hold
 * ->mmap_sem to walk the vma list of current->mm. Nasty, since it leaks
 * a struct file opened for write. Fixed. 2/6/2000, AV.
