 *  High-resolution kernel timers
 *
 *  In contrast to the low-resolution timeout API implemented in
 *  kernel/timer.c, hrtimers provide finer resolution and accuracy
 *  depending on system configuration and capabilities.
 *
 *  These timers are currently used for:
 *   - itimers
 *   - POSIX timers
 *   - nanosleep
 *   - precise in-kernel timing
