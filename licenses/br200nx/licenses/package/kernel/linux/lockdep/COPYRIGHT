 *
 * this code maps all the lock dependencies as they occur in a live kernel
 * and will warn about the following classes of locking bugs:
 *
 * - lock inversion scenarios
 * - circular lock dependencies
 * - hardirq/softirq safe/unsafe locking bugs
 *
 * Bugs are reported even if the current locking scenario does not cause
 * any deadlock at this point.
 *
 * I.e. if anytime in the past two locks were taken in a different order,
 * even if it happened for another task, even if those were different
 * locks (but of the same class as this lock), this code will detect it.
 *
 * Thanks to Arjan van de Ven for coming up with the initial idea of
 * mapping lock dependencies runtime.
