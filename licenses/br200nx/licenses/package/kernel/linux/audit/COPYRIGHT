/* audit.c -- Auditing support
 * Gateway between the kernel (e.g., selinux) and the user-space audit daemon.

 * Goals: 1) Integrate fully with Security Modules.
 *        2) Minimal run-time overhead:
 *           a) Minimal when syscall auditing is disabled (audit_enable=0).
 *           b) Small when syscall auditing is enabled and no audit record
 *              is generated (defer as much work as possible to record
 *              generation time):
 *              i) context is allocated,
 *              ii) names from getname are stored without a copy, and
 *              iii) inode information stored from path_lookup.
 *        3) Ability to disable syscall auditing at boot time (audit=0).
 *        4) Usable by other parts of the kernel (if audit_log* is called,
 *           then a syscall record will be generated automatically for the
 *           current syscall).
 *        5) Netlink interface to user-space.
 *        6) Support low-overhead kernel-based filtering to minimize the
 *           information that must be passed to user-space.
