 * Modified to make sys_syslog() more flexible: added commands to
 * return the last 4k of kernel messages, regardless of whether
 * they've been read or not.  Added option to suppress kernel printk's
 * to the console.  Added hook for sending the console messages
 * elsewhere, in preparation for a serial line console (someday).
 * Ted Ts'o, 2/11/93.
 * Modified for sysctl support, 1/8/97, Chris Horn.
 * Fixed SMP synchronization, 08/08/99, Manfred Spraul
 *     manfred@colorfullife.com
 * Rewrote bits to get rid of console_lock
