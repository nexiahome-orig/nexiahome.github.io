CONFIG_PACKAGE_libreadline

DESCRIPTION:=The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications
        that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs
        and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes
        additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command
        lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like
        history expansion on previous commands.
