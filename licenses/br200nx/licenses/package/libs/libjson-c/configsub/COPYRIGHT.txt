# Configuration subroutine to validate and canonicalize a configuration type.
# Supply the specified configuration type as an argument.
# If it is invalid, we print an error message on stderr and exit with code 1.
# Otherwise, we print the canonical config type on stdout and succeed.

# You can get the latest version of this script from:

# This file is supposed to be the same for all GNU packages
# and recognize all the CPU types, system types and aliases
# that are meaningful with *any* GNU software.
# Each package is responsible for reporting which valid configurations
# it does not support.  The user should be able to distinguish
# a failure to support a valid configuration from a meaningless
# configuration.

# The goal of this file is to map all the various variations of a given
# machine specification into a single specification in the form:
#       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
# or in some cases, the newer four-part form:
#       CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
# It is wrong to echo any other type of specification.
