# The first argument passed to this file is the canonical host specification,
#    CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-OPERATING_SYSTEM
# or
#    CPU_TYPE-MANUFACTURER-KERNEL-OPERATING_SYSTEM
# The environment variables CC, GCC, LDFLAGS, LD, with_gnu_ld
# should be set by the caller.
#
# The set of defined variables is at the end of this script.

# Known limitations:
# - On IRIX 6.5 with CC="cc", the run time search patch must not be longer
#   than 256 bytes, otherwise the compiler driver will dump core. The only
#   known workaround is to choose shorter directory names for the build
#   directory and/or the installation directory.
