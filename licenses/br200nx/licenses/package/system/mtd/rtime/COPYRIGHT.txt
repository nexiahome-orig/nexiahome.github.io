 * Very simple lz77-ish encoder.
 *
 * Theory of operation: Both encoder and decoder have a list of "last
 * occurrences" for every possible source-value; after sending the
 * first source-byte, the second byte indicated the "run" length of
 * matches
 *
 * The algorithm is intended to only send "whole bytes", no bit-messing.
