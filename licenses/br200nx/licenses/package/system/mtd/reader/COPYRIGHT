 *  This code was altered September 2001
 *  Changes are Copyright (c) Erik Andersen <andersen@codepoet.org>
 *
 * In compliance with (2) above, this is hereby marked as an altered
 * version of this software.  It has been altered as follows:
 *      *) Listing a directory now mimics the behavior of 'ls -l'
 *      *) Support for recursive listing has been added
 *      *) Without options, does a recursive 'ls' on the whole filesystem
 *      *) option parsing now uses getopt()
 *      *) Now uses printf, and error messages go to stderr.
 *      *) The copyright notice has been cleaned up and reformatted
 *      *) The code has been reformatted
 *      *) Several twisty code paths have been fixed so I can understand them.
 *  -Erik, 1 September 2001
 *
 *      *) Made it show major/minor numbers for device nodes
 *      *) Made it show symlink targets
